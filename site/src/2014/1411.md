Week 11 featured an unusual 4 matchups between top 10 teams. Top ranked New England
put on an impressive win against the 8th ranked Colts on their own turf. The hottest
team right now seems to be the Packers, who had no trouble keeping the Eagles
at bay. Green Bay keeps rising in our rankings and it will be an incredible
matchup when they will face the Patriots in a couple of weeks.

Even without Palmer and thanks to probably the best defense in the NFL, the Cardinals
look extremely tough. As one pundit said: they make other teams look bad. It's what
they did again to the Lions this week. In the West, Kansas City are prooving everyone
that last season wasn't a fluke by beating the reigning Champions.

At the bottom of the rankings, the lowly Bucaneers showed everyone in the league
just what a bad team the Redskins are.

Here's your week 11 rankings:
