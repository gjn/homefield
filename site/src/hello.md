This is homefield. The algorithmic NFL power ranking system completely void of
any bias. It takes the results, runs it through some algorithms, and spits
out some results.

Hopefully, those results will be presented in beautiful graphs sometimes
in the future. For now, there's nothing more the see here and you can either:

1. Get the last results [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjn/homefield/master/results.csv).

2. Play with the algorithm and create the results yourself by getting the code
from [here] https://github.com/gjn/homefield

SKOL!
