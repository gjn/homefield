With their win in Cincinnati, the Browns move up 7 places but stay behind the
Bengals in the Power Rankings. It was the biggest upset of the week as the 7th ranked
home team lost to the 30th ranked away team.

The 49ers once again prove why they are the best ranked road team in the NFL by
winning in New Orleans, breaking the Saints 11-game-win streak at home. The 49ers
climb to 4th place while the Saints just drop out of the top 10.

In these Power Rankings a win is a win. And when a very good home team like the
Packers thumb a very bad away team as the Bears, the rankings just shrug their
shoulders as Cutler would after an interception. The Packers move up just 1 spot while
the Bears lost only 1 slot.

Here's your week 10 rankings:
