description: The Panthers are for real
---

We still have 5 undefeated teams in the league. Without surprise, they
find themselves in the top spots of our Powerrankings.

Let's look at their recent strenght of schedule to gauge their
respective real strength.

The Bengals faced the toughest opponents as their recent schedule
rates at 0.64. Not far behind are the Patriots (0.61) and the Packers (0.58).

A little lower are the Panthers (0.48) who, outside of Seattle
this week, didn't really face tough competition.

The lowest rated strength of schedule is the property of the Denver
Broncos, whose opponnents rate at a weak 0.38.

Here's your week 6 rankings:
