The Browns moved up 7 places with the win at the Bengals but stay behind them
in these powerrankings. It was the biggest upset of the week as the 7th ranked
home team lost to the 30th ranked away team.

The 49ers once again provev why they are ranked the best away road team in the by
winning in New Orleans, breaking the Saints 11 straight wins at home, which ranked
them the 3rd best home team. The 49ers
climb to 4th place while the Saints just drop out of the top 10.

In these Power Rankings a win is a win. And when a very good home team like the
Packers stomp a very bad away team as the Bears, the rankings just shrug their
shoulders as Cutler would. The Packers moved up 1 spot while the Bears only
lost 2.

Here's your week 10 rankings:
